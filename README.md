# :postbox: Docker Containers Manager :postbox:

This project works with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)

It allows you to watch all your containers registered, if they are running or not and you can shutdown or start them

It is entirely based on the commands :
- docker-compose -f path/docker-compose.yml up -d
- docker-compose -f path/docker-compose.yml down

If you don't us docker-compose, if you use docker start or build or whatever, it won't work

This project is under development.
